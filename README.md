# Game of Thrones app in React ⚛️

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Sami Khalaf, and I've developed this app with React and some other libraries.

This is mainly an exercise for me to polish my skills as a front-end developer, so I hope you check this out and enjoy it as much as I did programming it.

## ✨ Key features

This is a SPA with some functionalities such as:

- Collects data from the Game Of Thrones API and print them in Characters and Houses pages.
- Displays in detail each character/house, with some extra data.
- Characters and Houses pages both have a reactive search bar
- Prints timeline, ordered by age for each house
- Has a "go back" button, using the History push API

Maybe I'll add some cool features in the future, such as:

- Light/Dark mode
- Has a language selector

## Regarding developement

- Modern JavaScript (ES2020) programming.
- Responsive design, developed in SCSS.
- Usage of BEM methodology for organising styles.

Enjoy!
